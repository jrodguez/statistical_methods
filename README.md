## Homework 3 is due Thurs. Feb 7 at 11:59 PM


### Description and purpose

The purpose of HW3 is to give you practice with the statistical methods we have reviewed over the last 3 lectures:  calculating descriptive statistics, distributions, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.  

A secondary goal is to give you further practice with data visualization

### Files contained in this skeleton HW repository

* README.me: this file
* HW3-SKEL.ipynb
* energyuse.csv: student electricity use data, described below
* GerberdingElectricityChilledWater.csv

### Instructions

More details are in the Jupyter notebook for HW3. Follow through the notebook and complete all your work there. When you are done, check back in your work. I will check out your completed work and grade it with a GitHub issue as before.

Note that I must be able to execute all cells in the notebook starting from top to bottom. I will "clear all output" from your notebook and then execute it all in order to make sure the notebook works.

### Note

The file energyuse.csv contains energy usage data for 5 chemical engineering undergraduate students. The final line of the file contains the national average of the data.  There are three types of data given:  lighting, electricity and total (just the same).  

Instructions are given in the skeleton notebook.

### A note about comments

Comments in python (using # in a code cell - or just adding a markdown cell) is critical so I can follow your work. You can't really over-comment things.

### A Note about collaboration

My expectation is that everything you type in a Python notebook is your own work.  Any instances of "copy-paste" from the web or another person's notebook should be clearly cited. Of course you may look at examples but it is my strong preference that you refrain from copy-paste and type everything in. There is a learning reason for this, which I am happy to discuss in office hours or on slack.

I will follow UW academic misconduct policy for any suspected instances of cheating on HW or projects. Any confirmed instance of cheating results in a zero on a HW assignment. Any 2nd confirmed instance of cheating results in a zero for the entire course grade.
